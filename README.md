# Anki Killstreaks

A Halo and Call of Duty inspired add-on that makes doing your reviews more bearable.

## Demo
![anki killstreaks](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3792672/71456492-a31e2d00-2767-11ea-8d2a-05c8f5af0d6e.gif)

### Features
Right now, the add-on features Halo 3 multi kills and kill streaks, that means: Double Kill, Triple Kill, Overkill, etc. and Killing Spree, Killing Frenzy, etc.

The multikills are shown if the time between seeing the question and showing the answer of a card is less than 8 seconds, and then if you mark either good or easy on the card.

### Future work

- A medal browser so you can see what you've earned
- Call of Duty MW2 Killstreaks
- Sound?

### Reporting issues
Please report issues through [Github](https://github.com/jac241/anki_killstreaks/issues). Include a detailed description, screenshot if possible, and the error message shown in Anki.

### Contributing

Contributing is definitely welcome. Submit a pull request with your changes. I generally stick to 80-column and PEP8 standards, and I prefer everything not touching Qt to be snake_case. If the changes you're making introduce complex logic, tests would be helpful. I use pytest.

### Special Thanks
Special thanks to Glutaminate, who has taken Anki to the next level.

# IMPORTANT:
# 
# If you are reading this and wondering where to find the
# configuration section:
#
# As part of porting this add-on to Anki 2.1 I had to move the 
# main add-on module to a separate folder. It is now located under
# puppy_reinforcer/main.py. All configuration options are located
# at the very top of that file.
#
# Please use NotePad++ or another text editor that supports python
# source code files to edit it
